## About the app
The app repesents the process of sorting.
You can manipulate the time and number of elements.

The application is written fully in React and styled with CSS.

The application is using <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/yield#:~:text=The%20yield%20keyword%20pauses%20generator,generator%20function%20that%20contains%20it.">yield</a> keyword to display the current state of the algorithm.

* On the far left, you can select the algorithm from the list.
* You can start or stop sorting by clicking on the "Start/Stop" button.
* Clicking on "Generate new array" will stop sorting and generate a new array with the same amount of elements.

* The time between actions slider allows adjusting how many milliseconds have to pass between two sorting actions.
A sorting action is comparing two elements and then reshuffling them.

* A number of elements slider adjusts a number of elements.
If you are running the app in the phone browser then the number of elements will be adjusted to your screen size.

* Each reshuffle action is highlighted.

## How to run it on your machine
